Simple and secure password management. Login automatically, never forget another password, stay in control of your passwords and improve their security. Powered by the world-renowned KeePass Password Safe.

KeeFox (http://keefox.org) adds free, secure and easy to use password management features to Firefox which save you time and keep your private data more secure.

KeeFox connects Firefox to KeePass Password Safe, the most popular open source (and free) password manager.

This repository contains the source code for the KeePassRPC plugin that needs to be installed inside KeePass in order for KeeFox to be able to connect your browser to your passwords.
